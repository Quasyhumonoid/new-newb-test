		<p>I don't really have anything good to show for my education. I've noticed a pattern in my life where I'll go above and beyond in structured tryouts in order to get to my goals but then I will do the minimum in order to pass. I feel like that makes me sort of trash.</p>
		<p>I got laid off from my position last month that I was proud to get but not proud to have, I worked like crazy in design core to get into INDD but I never got very good at drawing. I practiced songs to audition for musicals and plays but I would always slack off on memorizing my script until there were people yelling at me to get it done. I practiced hard on the basics to play tenor drums in marching band but never practiced my music when I got in so I was demoted to Bass drums the next year. </p>
		<p>You might also be able to tell that I might also have a tendency to remember things better that I'm emberrassed about, like my failures and mistakes, and that really makes me feel inadequate in most situations. This really makes it so that I have to compartmentalize myself into a new person when I'm trying to sell myself like when I'm applying for jobs, as I have been recently. I also have this thing were I feel like I tend to forget everything I'm not using on a regular basis. Because of this I have a hard time saying that I'm really skilled at or experienced in anything and seems to factor into what feels like reinventing the "compartment" that needs to ignore how worthless I consider myself to be. I have to look carefully at my resume, tell myself just because I haven't used Photoshop regularly in over two years doesn't mean that I don't know how to use Photoshop, I just need a little refresher which I want to do right now but I can't because I have to worry about applying for jobs and selling myself. </p>
		<p>It seems, this time, that my compartment is beginning to dissolve. I've been applying to the jobs that I've been interested in and that would pay enough for the last month and a half after I got my resume updated but I haven't heard a call back from a single one. It's starting to look like I will have to give up and work for PCA for a few years while fixing up the house that I'm trying to buy.</p>
